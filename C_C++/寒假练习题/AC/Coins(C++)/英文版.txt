He wanted to pay the exact price(without change) and he known the price would not more than m.But he didn't know the exact price of the watch. 
You are to write a program which reads n,m,A1,A2,A3...An and C1,C2,C3...Cn corresponding to the number of Tony's coins of value A1,A2,A3...An then calculate how many prices(form 1 to m) Tony can pay use these coins. 
 

Input
The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n(1<=n<=100),m(m<=100000).The second line contains 2n integers, denoting A1,A2,A3...An,C1,C2,C3...Cn (1<=Ai<=100000,1<=Ci<=1000). The last test case is followed by two zeros.
 

Output
For each test case output the answer on a single line.
